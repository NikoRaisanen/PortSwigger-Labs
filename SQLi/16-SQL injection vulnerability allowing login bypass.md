Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

Vulnerable area: Login page

SQL query for login is probably something like:

`SELECT * FROM users where username='<LOGIN_USERNAME>' and password='<PASSWORD>'`

Bypass login with following input in the username field: `administrator' and 1=1--`

Translation: log in as 'administrator' when 1=1 (always true)

Password field doesn't matter since it gets commented out with `--` in the username field... Put anything in the password box
