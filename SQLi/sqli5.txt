Lab: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle

Number of columns:
ORDER BY 1 and 2 work
ORDER BY 3 returns internal server error

' ORDER BY 2-- .. Orders by paragraph text
' ORDER BY 1-- .. Orders by bolded header text

Solved with following:

Datatable contains 2 rows, which is why I added null in select statement.
Selected null, banner so that 2 fields are populated
