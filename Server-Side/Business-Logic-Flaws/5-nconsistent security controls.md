# Lab: Inconsistent security controls

>This lab's flawed logic allows arbitrary users to access administrative functionality that should only be available to company employees. To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete Carlos.

### Vulnerable area
The description says that the exploit allows `arbitrary users` to access the admin account. We need to make an account. Upon login you have the option to change your email address...

### Solution
Just try to change your email address to anything@dontwannacry.com

Now you can access the admin page and delete carlos' account

Lab solved!
